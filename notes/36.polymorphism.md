Polymorphism

- compile-time, early binding, static binding
  - before program runs
- run-time, late binding, dynamic binding
  - at runtime

Wait till runtime - use virtual 

Non Polymorphic Example
- pass an account derived object into func
- will call the base class function instead of derived

Polymorphism - Dynamic Binding
- use the implementation in the  derived class
Account *p = new Trust();
p->withdraw(1000); //Trust::withdraw();

Account *p1 = new Account();
Account *p2 = new Savings();
Account *p3 = new Checking();
Account *p4 = new Trust();

Vector<Account *> accounts {p1, p2, p3, p4};

for(auto acc_ptr: accounts)
    acc_ptr->withdraw();

delete p1;
delete p2;
delete p3;
delete p4;

-------------

virtual functions - overridden functions 
treat all objects as base class objects 

define func to override as virtual in base class 

class Account {
    public:
    virtual void withdraw(double amount);
}

class Checking: public Account {
    public: 
        virtual void withdraw(double amount);
}

- signature and return type must match exactly

// dont have to use virtual keyword in derived class
// but it is best practice to continue to use it 

virtual destructors

- if derived class is destroyed by deleting storage via base class pointer and class is non-virtual destructor, behavior is undefined. 

virtual functions -> virtual destructor
virtual ~Account();

-----------
Override specifier
- we can override base class virtual functions
- if signatures dont match perfectly, get redefinition
- redefinition is statically bound
- overriding is dynamically bound
- hard to find this error

class Base {
    public:
        virtual  void say_hello() const {}
}

class Derived: public Base {
    public:
        virtual void say_hello(){  // forgot the const! NOT OVERRIDING

        }
}

// can use override specifier
// override with throw error if not overriding anything

------------

Final Specifier 
- class level and function level

- prevents class from being derived from
class My_class final {}
class Derived final : public Base {}

- prevents function from being overridden

class B: public A {
    virtual void do_someething() final; // prevent overriding
}

------
Base Class References

Account a;
Account &ref = a;
ref.withdraw(1000); // Account::withdraw

Trust t;
Account &ref1 = t;
ref1.withdraw(1000); // Trust::withdraw
