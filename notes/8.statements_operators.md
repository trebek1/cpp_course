Numbers are casted up for math
numbers are casted down for assignment

double / int => double

but

int total = 10.5 + 10 = 20;

Can specify the cast with static_cast<type>

double average {0.0};
average static_cast<double>(total)/count;
average = (double)total/count // old style => dont do it

cout << boolalpha; // will display true/false instead of 1/0 for booleans

12.0 == 11.99999999999999 // boolean true!

- stores an approximation
