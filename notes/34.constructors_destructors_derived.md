constructors fire base => children
destructors fire derived => base

Derived class does NOT inherit
1. base class constructors
2. base  class destructors 
3. base class overloaded assignment operators 
4. base class friend functions 

if derived class is instantiated defaults to 
invoking no args base constructor before itself

using Base::Base;
-- explict inheritance of base 'non special' constructors 

Passing Args from derived class constructor to base constructor

class Base {
    public:
        Base();
        Base(int);
}

Derived::Derived(int x): Base(x), {};

// now will use overloaded constructor
class Derived: public  Base {
    int doubled_value;
    public:
    Derived(): Base{}, double_value{0}{}
    Derived(int x): Base{x}, doubled_value {x*2} {}
}
