cout sin cerr clog are objects representing streams 

cout 
- standard output stream
- console

cin 
- standard input stream
- keyboard

<< 
-- insertion operator
-- output streams 

>> 
-- extraction operator
-- iniput streams 

all input streams read from buffer so if you cin 100 200 
it will put 100 in first integer and 200 in second, no need to enter twice 

edge case: putting in 10.5
if reading an integer and a double, 10 will come in as integer 0.5 as double since it is still in buffer
