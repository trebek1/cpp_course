Arrays and Vectors 

-- array elements assigned in one chunk in memory 
-- have certain size 

declaring an  array: 
Element_Type  array_name [constant number of elements]
cout an array gives it's address
getting one element is arr[i] 

address of array is first element in the array address 

Vectors are dynamic arrays 
-- container in the STL 
-- Vector is an object 
-- has functions such as reverse, find, sort etc 

#include <vector>
using namespace std;
vector<char> vowels;
vector<int> test_scores;

vector <char> vowels (5); // can give it an initial size 
- can also use initializer list like an array 
- vector<double> hi_temps (365, 80.0) // make all 365 entries 80
- vectors initialized to zero (for integers) not garbage 
- vector has push_back method 
- out of bounds => throws an exception (error message)
