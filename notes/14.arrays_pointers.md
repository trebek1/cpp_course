Arrays and Pointers

- Pointer and array name is the same 
- Array name is not a variable 

int scores[] {100, 95, 89};

cout << scores << endl; // 0x61fec8
cout << *scores << endl; // 100

int *score_ptr {scores};

cout << score_ptr << endl; // 0x61fec8
cout << *score_ptr << endl; // 100 

Can get an array indexed value from a ptr
C++ doesnt have true arrays 
Array is just pointer to first element in array
*(score_ptr) //100
*(score_ptr + 1) //  95
increased by 4 bc added 4 bytes to where pointer was at 

score_ptr + 2 // 89 
- called offset notation 
- subscript notation is array_name[index];
