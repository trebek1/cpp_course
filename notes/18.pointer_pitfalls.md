Pointer Pitfalls

1. uninitialized pointers
   1. could point anywhere if not initialized
2. dangling pointers
   1. pointer that is released to memory (not valid)
   2. returning addresses of functions no longer on stack
   3. 2 pointers point to same data 
3. not checking if new failed
   1. if new fails an exception is thrown
   2. deref null pointers causes program to crash
4. leaking memory
   1. forget to release allocated memory with delete 
   2. if you lose pointer to storage, no way to get it 
   3. memory is orphaned or leaked 
   4. most common pointer problems 
   5. can run out of memory on heap
