What is a reference
- an alias for a variable 
- cannot be null
- once init cannot be made to refer to different var 
- useful as function params 
- ref can be though of as a constant pointer that is automatically dereferenced

// does not change values! str is copy!
for(auto str: stooges){
    str = "Funny";
}

// changes values! str is NOT a copy!
for(auto &str: stooges){
    str = "Funny";
}

// compiler error, cant assign 
// const marks reference as read-only
for(auto const &str: stooges){
    str = "Funny";
}

for(auto str:stooges){
    cout << str << endl;
}

-- can only reference l values 
int num {5};

num can be used as a reference but cant assign a 
reference to the integer 5;
