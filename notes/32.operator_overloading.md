Operator Overloading 

- operators work with primitives by default  
- +,*,= etc.

For objects = is only one with default
-  operator overloading => syntactic sugar 

Cant overload
::, :?, .*, ., sizeof

Overloading the copy assignment operator (deep copy)

Type &Type::operator=(const Type &rhs);

Mystring &Mystring::operator=(const Mystring &rhs);
// when this is  written...
s2 = s1;
// this is called..
s2.operator=(s1); //operator= method is called
