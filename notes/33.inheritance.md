Inheritance 

- Create new classes from existing classes
- new class has data and behaviors of other class
- allow for reuse of existing classes

Player => Enemy, Boss, Hero,Super Player, etc 

Inheritance
- process of creating new classes from exising classes
- reuse mechanism

Single Inheritance 
- new class from single class

Multiple Inheritance 
- new class from 2+ other classes

Base Class 
- parent class
- class being extended from

Derived Class
- class being created from base 
- inherit attributes 

Is-A relationship
- public inheritance 
- derived classes are subtypes of base class
- derived is a base 

Generalization - combine similar classes to single general class

Specialization - Add atributes to general class

Inheritance Class Hierarchies 
- how to organize code 
- inheritance triangle to base -> 

Composition
- has-a relationship
- person has a Account
- player has a special attack
- circle has a location

inheritance => more complexity

class Person {
    private:
    std::string name;
    Account account // has a relationship
}

notation

class Base {

}

class Derived: access-specifier Base {

}

access specifier => public, private, protected

public => is a 
private/protected => has a 

Example - Deriving Savings Account class from Account

class Account {}
class Savings_Account: public Account{};

Savings_Account is a Account

Account account {};
Account *p_account = new Account();

same notation for Savings_Account

Savings_Account sav_account{};
Savings_Account *p_sav_account = new Savings_Account();

sav_account.deposit(1000.0);
p_sav_account->withdraw(200.0);

delete p_sav_account;

protected class members
- like private members 
- accessible from derived classes and base class
- not accessible by objects of base or derived class

class Base {
    public:
    int a;
    protected:  
    int b;
    private: 
    int c;
};

Derived class
- public: a; 
- protected: b;
- c: no access!

protected inheritance:
base has public a, protected b, private c
derived has protected a, protected b and no c 

private inheritance:
base has public a, protected b, private c
derived has private a, private b and no access to c;

if you inherit from a parent with private var 
you dont have access to it but it is there in the 
object itself

Copy and Move constructors and overloaded operator= with inheritance 

not inherited from base class 
can invoke base class versions from derived class

Just modify the copy constructor with the Base class init 

Derived::Derived(const Derived &other): Base(other, {...init list}){};
- compiler uses slicing to slice out base part  

Overloaded copy assignment 

Derived &operator=(const Derived  &rhs){
    if(this != &rhs){
        Base::operator=(rhs); // assign base part
        doubled_value=rhs.doubled_value; //  assign derived part
    }
    return *this;
}
