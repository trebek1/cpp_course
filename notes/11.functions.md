Functions 

- functions have to be defined before they are called or the compiler will not know about them 

- can define function prototype so that you dont need this ordering
- put all at the top of the file 
- can define header file for holding these prototypes

function prototype

int function_name(int); // place at top of file 
void function_name();
void function_name(int a, std::string b);


// will catch compiler errors if not following proto

---------------
Data is passed into functions by value (by copy)
-- by default (even vectors etc)
------------
Can have default arguments  at the tail end of parameter list

double calc_cost(double base_cost, double tax_rate = 0.06)
write default in function prototype 

--------

must implement all overloaded versions of functions 

int add(int a, int b);
double add(double a, double b);

- can create a template when same structure is present 
- return type is not considered 
- c style strings are promoted to string 

--------
- array elements are not copied 
- just address 
- have to pass in size of array
- pass size_t as well as size of array
- passing (const int numbers [], size_t size) will not allow someone to modifiy array passed in 

-------
pass by reference
- pass an alias to actual object 

void scale_number(int &num); // can change the num! 
// swap function!

void swap(int &a, int &b); !!!

---------
vector is passed by value by default (a new copy is made when passed in)

void print(std::vector<int> v);
-- update to pass by reference!
void print(std::vector<int> &v);

void print(const std::vector<int> &v); // now cant edit it!
