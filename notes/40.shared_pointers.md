Shared Pointers

provides shared ownership of heap object 

shared_ptr<T>
- points to object of type T on heap
- not unique
- can be assigned and copied
- can be moved 
- when use count is zero, managed object is deleted
(reference count)

std::shared_ptr<int> p1 {new int{100}};
std::cout  <<*p1<< std::endl;

*p1 = 200;

// deallocated when goes out of scope 

p1.use_count(); // returns number pointers that reference the heap object

std::shared_ptr<int> p2 {p1};

std::cout <<p1.use_count()<< std::endl; // 2

can push shared_ptr to vector (copy)

std::shared_ptr<int> p1 = make_shared<int>(100);
std::shared_ptr<int> p2 {p1};
std::shared_ptr<int> p3;

p3 = p1; // use_count = 3;

use make_shared
all 3 pointers point to same object on the heap

-----------------------------------------------
weak_ptr
weak_ptr<T>
- points to object on heap
- does not participate in ownership
- always created from shared_ptr
- does not increment or decrement use count
- used to prevent strong ref cycles which could 
  - prevent objects from being deleted 

Cycle References
a refers to b 
b refers to a 

(destructor never called after main is done)
- reference in each class to one an other

--------------------------------------------

Custom Deleters
- need to destroy more than just object on the heap
- special use cases 
- called when pointer is destroyed
- provide deleter function to ptr on create

void my_deleter(Test *ptr){
    delete ptr;
}

shared_ptr<Some_Class> ptr {new Some_Class{}, myDeleter};
