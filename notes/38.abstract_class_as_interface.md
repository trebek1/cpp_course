Using Abstract Class as Interface 

- Interface - class in c++ that has only virtual functions
- must be public functions
- any class can override and use as needed
- all must be implemented

class Printable {
    frend ostream &operator << (ostream &, const Printable &obj);
    public:
    virtual void print(ostream &os) const =0;
    virtual  ~Printable(){};
    ...
}

ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const Printable &obj){
    obj.print(os);
    return os;
}

Printable Example
- must be derived from printable 
- must  override Printable.print

class Any_Class: public Printable {
    public:
        virtual void print(ostream *os) override {
            os << "Hi from Any_class";
        }
        ...
};
