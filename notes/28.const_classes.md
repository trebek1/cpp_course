Using Const with Classes

Pass arguments to class member methods as const 
can create const objects 
const-correctness

const Player villain {"Villain", 100, 55};
// once we create villain we can't change it's attributes

void display_player_name(const Player  &p){
    cout << p.get_name() << endl;

    display_player_name(villain); // error
}

// get name could potentially change object so error

Tell object that method will not modify object

class Player {
    private:
    ...
    public:
    std::string get_name() const;
    ...
};

const correctness.
- if you write code in the cost fn you get compiler error

- if you dont modify object => should be const
