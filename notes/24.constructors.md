    Player(std::string name,  int health, int xp);
}

When you leave block the destructor is called 
when object declared in block

objects destructed in reverse order as defined(destructor stack);

}

// initialzer lists 
// init before body of constructor 
Player::Player():name{"None"}, health{0}, xp{0}{}
