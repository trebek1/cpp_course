Pointers 

- want to be able to handle our own memory

Pointer - variable -> stores address of another variable or function

To declare a pointer 

variable_type *pointer_name 

int *int_ptr;
double* double_ptr; 
// can put star next to name or next to type 
char *char_ptr;
string *string_ptr;

init all pointer variables before using them

int *int_ptr {};
double* double_ptr {nullptr};

uninitialized pointers can point anywhere w/garbage data 

----------
to get address of a variable 

int num{10};
-- variables stored at unique address 
cout << "Address of num is " << &num; // unary operator 

int *p;

cout << value of p << p << endl; // 0x61ff60
cout << "address of p << &p << endl; // 0x61ff18
cout << sizeof p << sizeof p << 4 
p = nullptr;
cout << value of p << p << end; // 0;

// all pointers are 4 bytes
// vector<string> *p4 {nullptr}; // sizeof => 4 

int score {10};
double high_temp {100.7};
int *score_ptr {nullptr};
score_ptr = &score;
score_ptr = &high_temp; // compiler error cant point to double with int pointer;

& - the address operator 

------------------------

Dereferencing the pointer 
- follow pointer to where the pointer is pointing to 
- if score_ptr is a pointer and has valid address 
you can use *score_ptr to get it's value

initialize with * and dereference with *
